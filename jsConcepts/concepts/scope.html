           <p><strong>Global::</strong> When somebody say global, what comes to your mind? You will try to visualize the globe you have seen in high school. If you have never been to a high school, have a look at Image -1.</p>
           <p><strong>Global Star::</strong> Look at image -2. If you cant see a person in the top right corner, borrow a magnifying glass from your grandma. It's Jackie Chan. He is a global star. People will recognize him from any part of the world.</p>
           <p><strong>Global Variable::</strong> Global variable is exactly like global star. you can access it (get or set the value of it), from any part of you application.</p>

          <p><strong>Global Events::</strong> So, you can easily recognize global star like Nelson Mandela, Princess Diana, etc. Similarly, you can easily recognize global activities like "New Year celebration", "Christmas", "Olympic Games", etc. from any part of the world. Have a look at Image -5.</p>
          <p><strong>Global Functions::</strong> Similarly, global functions could be accessible from any part of your application.</p>
          <p><strong>Global Scope::</strong> Anything in the global scope could be accessible from any part of your application. Have a look into Image -6. You can have global variables like global stars and global functions like global events/activities.</p>

         <p>In the code block below, "a" is a global variable and "b" is a global function. you can access global variable from anywhere of your application including inside of the function "b". Anything which is not inside of a function, is global.</p>
          <pre><code>
//global variable
var a = 2;

//global function
function b(){
   console.log(a);  //access global variable

b(); //execute global function.

          <h4>Take away</h4>
          <p> Global variables are exactly like global stars. You can access them (get or set value of it), from any part of your application. Global functions are like global events. You can execute (call) them from any part of your application.</p>          
          <p>Global variables and functions are executed in the global context. If you need to understand more about JavaScript context, read <a href="http://davidshariff.com/blog/what-is-the-execution-context-in-javascript/">Execution context and Stack in JavaScript</a> or watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuo8YqKDQ-M">Understanding JavaScript this in a crystal clear way</a></p>

           <h2>2. Local Scope</h2>

           <p><strong>Local::</strong> When somebody says local, what comes to your mind? If you are smart like me, you will say, something that is not global. Think about a part of the world. For example, the USA. It's a country, a part of the world. If you don't know where is the USA, I marked it for you in Image -7.</p>
           <p><strong>Local Star::</strong> Look at image -8. If you are in the USA, you might know her as she makes a lot of news (somehow manage to make news). But people outside of the USA, will not recognize her. Sher is a local star.</p>
           <p><strong>Local Variable::</strong> Local variables are exactly like local stars. you can access it (get or set the value of it), only in the local scope. In JavaScript local scope is defined by a function. If you declare a variable inside a function, you can only aWscess it (get or set value), inside the function. If you want to access it from outside of the function, you will get a reference error.</p>

          <p><strong>Local Events::</strong> Think about American football (Image-10). Not the football (soccer) rest of the world knows. It's crazily famous here including super bowl. But people outside of the world doesn't know about  it. </p>
          <p><strong>Local Functions:: </strong>Similarly, any functions inside a function is a local function. You can only execute it inside the outer function.</p>
          <p><strong>Local Scope::</strong> Anything in the local scope (inside a function) is only accessible inside that local scope. You can compare local variables are like local stars and local functions are like local events. Have a look at Image-11.</p>
          <p><strong>Scope Chain::</strong> Local scope is connected to the global scope. In the Image-12, see a dotted line/chain towards global scope. Thats the way you have access to any global variables/functions. This link/chain is called scope chain. We will talk more about it later.</p>

          <p>In the code block below, "d" is a local variable. you can access it (get or set value) inside the function "b". If you want to access it outside of the function, you will get a reference error.</p>
          <pre><code>
var a = 2; 
function b(){
   var d = 21; //local variable
   console.log(d); //can access it inside the function
}
b();  // 21

console.log(d); //ReferenceError: d is not defined
          </code></pre>    
         <p><strong>Implicit Global::</strong> if you forget to put var in front of the variable inside a function, it becomes a global variable. In the code block below, "a", "e" and "i" are global variables. You might not wanted "e" and "i" to be global. So, be careful.</p>
         <pre><code>
var a = 21;

function b(){
  var d = 7;
  e = 14;
  for(i =0; i&lt;5; i++){
    console.log(e);  
  }  
}

          <p> Local variables are exactly like local stars. You can access it (get or set value of it) only inside that scope. Local function is like local events. you can execute (celebrate) only inside that scope.</p>          
          <p>Local variables and functions are executed in the local context.</p>
       </div>
       <div id="multipleScope">
           <h2>3. Multiple Scope</h2>
           <p><strong>Multiple functions::</strong> If you have more than one functions and you execute them, each one of them will create their own scope. However, every execution context will be linked to the global scope. Thats how you will have access to the global scope. Have a look at Image -13.</p>
           <p><strong>Nested Scope::</strong> If you have a function inside of another function and you execute the inner function. The inner function will create a scope inside the outer function. Look at the Image-14. Remember, the inner scope will have access to the outer function variable and outer one will have access to the global variable. Stare at Image-14 for 5 minutes and shed tears for 3 minutes.</p>
           <p><strong>Closure::</strong> If you have a function inside a function, this is called closure. Closure is a powerful feature of JavaScript for encapsulation. Some of your function could be closure (Image-15). Don't worry about it for now, You will have a crystal clear idea about closure soon.</p>

          <h4>Block Scope</h4>
          <p>Block scope is a block/ part of a code surrounded by {}. JavaScript doesn't support block scope. Read more about block scope at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Statements?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=JavaScript%2FGuide%2FStatements#Block_Statement">MDN: block scope</a></p>
          <pre><code>
function getY(){
  var x = 5;
  if(x>0){
    var y = 7;  
  }
  return y;
}

getY(); //7
          </code></pre>
          <p>Not supporting block scope, makes javaScript easier to understand, less complexity and perform better. Hoisting also plays a role here. You will learn about hoisting soon.</p>
          <h4>ES6: let</h4>
         <p> You cannot have block scope but you can have block variable when ES6 "let" would be supported by major browsers. Read MDN documents to learn more about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let">let</a>.</p>
       </div>
          <h4>Take away</h4>
          <p>You will have as many function context as many function you have executed. Function inside a function will create a nested scope inside of the scope of the outer function. There would be a new scope, even a function calls itself. However, you will have only one global context.</p>

            <li><strong>Third (Other part of the house): </strong> If you live in big apartment building. You will look into inside of the building. May be in the front lobby (the way you get in to your apartment)</li>
            <li><strong>Fourth (Outside): </strong> Next step would be check outside of the house (Image-18) in the backyard or roadside where ever your park your car.</li>

            <h4>Why are you telling this stupid every weekend story?</h4>
         <div>If you ask for a variable inside a function, JavaScript doesn't know right away whether this variable you are asking for is a  global variable or local variable. So, it has to follow the following steps.
         <ul>
            <li><strong>First (Local Scope): </strong>It checks local variable. if it is in the local scope will grab it and give it to you.</li>
            <li><strong>Second (Parameters): </strong>If the variable doesn't exists in the local scope then it check to the parameters. Similar to keys in the key holder (Image-17)</li>
            <li><strong>Third (Outer Scopes) </strong> If the variable you are asking for doesn't exists in the parameter then it starts walking outside of the function via scope chain of the current scope until it hits the end of the chain. The end of the scope is called "window" object in JavaScript.</li>
            <li><strong>Fourth (Window): </strong> If the variable exists in the global scope, it would be a property of the global object "window". JavaScript will grab it an give it to you.</li>
            <li><strong>Fifth (Undefined): </strong>If the variable doesn't exists in the window object, JavaScript will return "undefined". This means the variable you are looking for, doesn't exists.</li>

         <h2>5. Access Global Variable</h2>
          <p><strong>Climbing through the Scope Chain: </strong> If you are asking for a global variable from inside of a function, you are climbing through the scope chain. In the code example you are climbing the scope chain for 1,000,000. Every single time, you have to check localScope, parameters and then get outside of the function. If you have more than one function inside function, then it becomes even more expensive.</p>          
          <pre><code>
var myArr = [0,1,2,3, ...., 1000000];

function getSum(){
  var sum = 0;
  for (var i =0; i&lt;1000000; i++){
    sum += myArr[i];
  }    
  return sum;
}

getSum();
          </code></pre>
          <p>If you have to access global variable for hundred times, you can have a local copy of the global variable. In that case you dont have to climb through the scope chain.</p>
          <pre><code>
var myArr = [0,1,2,3, ...., 1000000];

function getSum(){
  var sum = 0;
  var localArr = myArr;
  for (var i =0; i&lt;1000000; i++){
    sum += localArr[i];

         <h2>6. Hoisting</h2>
         <p>Hoist is a verb which means raise something by means of rope and pulley. If you have never seen a hoist in your life, look at Image-19. Hoist is used in the factories to raise heavy things. One benefit of raising something at the ceiling is, you can see it from any part of the room/factory. (Image-20)</p>
         <p>JavaScript does the exact same thing to hoist (raise) variable declaration and function declaration at the top of function scope. so that those variables and functions could be used from any part of the function without raising no reference Exception.</p>
         <p>Compare this with floating of stuff. or find good example</p>

         <p>If you execute the following foo function, you will get undefined.</p>
         <pre><code>
function foo(){
  return b;
  var b = 7;  
}

foo(); //undefined
         </code></pre>
         <p>While creating <a href="http://davidshariff.com/blog/what-is-the-execution-context-in-javascript/">Context</a> of a function, JavaScript execution engine, scan through the whole function and bring variable declaration at the top of the scope. Please note the value assignment will not be hoisted. Since, only variable declaration is hoisted, the default value of unassigned variable is "undefined". Hence, you will get "undefined" returned as value of "b".</p>

         <pre><code>
function foo(){
  var b;
  return b;
  b = 7;
}
foo(); //undefined
         </code></pre>
         <p>Similarly if you assign a function to a variable (function expression) only the variable part will be hoisted. However if you have a function declaration, the full function will be hoisted.</p>
         <h4>Hoisting Process</h4>
         <p> You can google more about it or read spec or explore V8 code. And if you find any good materials, please let me know.</p>
         <ul>
           <li><strong>function: </strong>Any function declaration will be hoisted at the top.</li>
           <li><strong>variable: </strong>And then the variable declaration will be hoisted. If you have a function expression (set function to a variable), only the variable part will be hoisted. the assignment of the function to a variable will stay at its place.</li>           
         </ul>
         <p>In the following code block, you have a function expression where function is assigned to a variable "bar" and a function declaration named as "foo" and a variable "a".</p>
         <pre><code>
function myFunc() {    
    var bar = function() {
            return 'world';
        };    
    function foo() {
        return 'fooed';
    }
    var a = 5;
}
         </code></pre>
         <p>The above mentioned code after hoisting will look like</p>
         <pre><code>
function myFunc() {
    function foo() {
        return 'fooed';
    }    
    var bar;
    var a;    
    bar = function() {
            return 'world';
        };
    a = 5;        
}
         </code></pre>
         <h4>Take Away</h4>
         <p>Only the declaration of a variable is hoisted. Value assigned remains at its location. Function declaration is hoisted. If you have a function expression only the variable part of the function expression will be hoisted.</p>

       <div id="closure">
         <h2>7. Closure</h2>
         <p>if you have a function inside a function, execution of the inside function will create a scope inside of the outer function. Since, insider function scope is enclosed by outer function scope. The inner function scope is called closure. Remember, to be a closure, you dont have to return a function, you just have to call a function inside a function</p>
         <pre><code>
function a(){
  function b(){
     console.log('closure');
  }
  b(); //creates closure
}
         </code></pre>
         <p><strong>Useful Closure:: </strong>Closure is a powerful feature of JavaScript. Let's have a look into the following example. we have a outer function that has a local/private variable "i" and it return a function. Inside the returning function, the inner function returns the value of i and increases it by 1.</p>
         <pre><code>
function counter(){
    var i = 0;
    
    return function(){
       return i++;
    }
}
         </code></pre>
         <p> <strong>Step-1: </strong>In the following core, we execute counter function and assign the result of counter to a variable "a". Hence, the value of a will be the inner function which would be return by executing function counter.</p>
         <p><strong>Step-2: </strong> Now if you execute function "a" (execute inner function), it will return 0 (value of i)  and will increase it by 1. If you execute function "a" again it will return 1 (current value of i)  and will increase the value of "i" by 1. Hence, you will get 2, 3, 4, 5 ....</p>
         <p>This means, closure hold the state of local/private variable in the outer scope. And every time, you call it you get a value increased by 1.</p>
                  
         <pre><code>
var a = counter();
a(); //0
a(); //1
a(); //2
a(); //3
a(); //4
a(); //5
         </code></pre>
         <p>Now you can have another variable "b" and assign the execution result of the function counter. If you execute "b" (the inner function of counter), you will get 0. if you execute again, you will get 1. and then 2, 3, 4, ...</p>
         <pre><code>
var b = counter();
b(); //0
b(); //1
b(); //2
b(); //3
         </code></pre>

          <p>This means, each closure maintain separate private variable of the outer function.</p>
         <p><strong>Encapsulation:: </strong>You would not be able to access (get or set) the value of "i" form outside. Hence the privacy of the value of "i" is maintained secretly. This is called encapsulation in object oriented programming.</p>
